# NS_Solver_SIMPLE
Implemented a NS solver using SIMPLE algorithm and solved the benchmark cavity problem. There are some small bugs that have to be fixed. But the thoery behind the code is well established. I used reference from a CFD book written by Versteeg. I found the explanation in this book to be better compared to the Patankar book. Next part is to implement the channel flow benchmark problem using this code.
